# ReactDex: A React based Pokedex App

This project is currently a work in progress. In the app's current state, a user is able to search for a pokemon and navigate to that pokemon's page. While a pokemon's page currently displays a name, sprite, and typing, I am working on adding more data such as base stats and abilities. There is a lot of visual formatting that still needs to be done as well.
